# Vitae C

## Inspiration 
Creating a resume can be very daunting when first starting your career, especially when many conventions for the job application process and industry-specific norms are not easily accessible to the aspiring workforce. 

## What it does 
Vitae C's name is derived from Curriculum Vitae or CV. In Latin, Vitae translates to "of life" and Vitae C aims to give your CV and resumes a new life, hence why Vitae C is the reverse of CV. Vitae C is dedicated to making career resources more accessible to those with diverse backgrounds and goals who are hoping to kick start their career. 

## How we built it 
We first started out by visualizing and designing the program’s prototype with Figma. We agreed upon the website’s color palette, layout, and key features, while adding interactive transitions to each frames. While half of the team designs the website on Figma, the other half implements the visualization with React and CSS. 

## Challenges we ran into 
Our biggest challenge when designing this prototype was creating the animations and transitions. Whether it be in Figma or CSS, our limited experience in both softwares made it difficult to maintain a clean workspace and result. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
Everyone in the team have minimal to no past experience in React or Figma. However, we are so proud that we can successfully implement these softwares and make a project come to life!

## What we learned 
In addition to learning new technical skills, like Figma and React, we learned that reaching out for help is a crucial learning supplement. By being brave and taking the time to discuss problems with assigned mentors, we can get inspired to improve and elevate our project.
 
## What's next for Vitae C 
We hope to add more relevant career resources, like adding a resume parser or ATS API, in the future to make Vitae C the one-stop platform for everyone’s resume help.
